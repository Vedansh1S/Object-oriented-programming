# OOP Concepts in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is based on four main principles:

## 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit. It helps in data hiding and controlled access.

## 2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. It promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification.

## 3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows the same method or action to behave differently based on the object or context, providing flexibility in code.

## 4. Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on *what* an object does, not *how* it does it.
